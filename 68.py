# loop through tthe index  numbers

# use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable


# print all items by refering to their index numbers


thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for i in range(len(thislist)):
    print(thislist[i])



# the iterate created in the example above is [0, 1, 2
