#Python String Formatting

# F-String was introduced in Python 3.6,

#Before Python 3.6 we had to use the format() method.

# F-Strings
# F-string allows you to format selected parts of a string.

# To specify a string as an f-string,
# simply put an f in front of the string literal, like this:


txt = f"the price is 49 dollars"
print(txt)
