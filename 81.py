# customise Sort Functiion

# tou can  also customise your own function by
# using the keyword argument key = function

# the function will  return
# a number that will be used to sort the list ( the lowest number first)

# sort the list based on how close the numbers is to 50


def myfunc(n):
    return abs(n - 50)

thislist = [100, 50, 65, 82, 23]


thislist.sort(key= myfunc )
print(thislist)



# myfunc (100) return abs (100 - 50) = 50
# myfunc (50) return abs (50 - 50) = 0
# myfunc (65) return abs (65 - 50) = 50
# myfunc (82) return abs (82 - 50) = 32
# myfunc (23) return abs (23 - 50) = 27



#The list is sorted based on these returned values:
#50 (from 100)
#0 (from 50)
#15 (from 65)
#32 (from 82)
#27 (from 23)
#The sorted order of the list will be: [50, 65, 23, 82, 100],
# which corresponds to sorting by the absolute difference from 50.
